# mbpls-em

Probabilistic multi-block PLS with EM estimation.

This package implements a probabilistic latent variable model for integrating multiple datasets (blocks) measured on different samples, decomposing shared and dataset-specific structure, and estimating parameters via an Expectation–Maximization (EM) algorithm.

## Features

- Shared and block-specific latent structure
- EM-based maximum likelihood estimation
- Orthonormal loading updates
- Simulation utilities
- Subspace and reconstruction metrics
- Modular design for research use
